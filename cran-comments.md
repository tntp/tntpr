*   Note: the word "TNTP" in README.md and in DESCRIPTION is the name of an organization, not an acronym or mis-spelled word. Although TNTP used to stand for "The New Teacher Project", that name was dropped around 2013 (as the organization branched out into areas beyond new teacher training) and the current name is not an acronym for anything.
