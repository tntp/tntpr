## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

*   Clarified "TNTP" in the CMD check comments below
*   Added documentatoin of values to theme_tntp.Rd and theme_tntp_2018.Rd
*   Removed \dontrun{} tags from all examples
*   Fixed the error in setup_subdirectory.Rd example code

A comment on the original submission said: 

*"If there are references describing the methods in your package, please add these in the description field of your DESCRIPTION file in the form authors (year) <doi:...> authors (year) <arXiv:...> authors (year, ISBN:...) or if those are not available: <[https:...]https:...> with no space after 'doi:', 'arXiv:', 'https:' and angle brackets for auto-linking. (If you want to add a title as well please put it in quotes: "Title")"*

This package doesn't reference academic publications, so there are no references to document.

*   Note: the word "TNTP" in README.md is the name of an organization, not an acronym or mis-spelled word.
*   This is a new release.
