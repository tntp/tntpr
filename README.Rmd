About
-----

The `tntpr` package makes data science at TNTP easier and more accurate
by supplying tools that are needed for common TNTP analyses. Because
this package specifically serves the TNTP analysis community, functions
can be tailored to our exact use cases.

Package summary
---------------

Some of the highlights of the package include:

-   TNTP-themed RMarkdown templates, for starting a new analysis with a
    shell that can already generate a TNTP-themed .docx report
-   TNTP-specific ggplot2 theme and color palette
-   Functions for initializing a new repository or project folder with
    TNTP-standard directories and documentation
-   Survey analysis tools
-   Wrappers for quickly making typical TNTP-style charts (e.g., bar
    chart of means on variable 1 grouped by variable 2)
-   Education-specific data management functions (e.g., `date_to_SY()`
    to convert continuous hire dates into school years using a specified
    cutoff date), and a built-in fake student achievement dataset to
    play with called `wisc`.

`tntpr` is built to work with the tidyverse set of packages.

Installing the package
----------------------

This package is not on CRAN, and probably will not ever be. Youâ€™ll need
to install this package from its GitHub repository. You can add this to
the top of your analysis script:

## Install the `tntpr` package

`tntpr` is not on CRAN, so you will have to install it directly from Github using `devtools`.

If you do not have the `devtools` package installed, you will have to run the first line in the code below as well.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('tntp/tntpr')
```

Once installed, you load it like any other package.

```{r}
library(tntpr)
```

Once installed, you can update the package with `update_tntpr()`.
