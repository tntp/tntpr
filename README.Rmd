About
-----

The `tntpr` package makes data science at TNTP easier and more accurate
by supplying tools that are needed for common TNTP analyses. Because
this package specifically serves the TNTP analysis community, functions
can be tailored to our exact use cases.

Package summary
---------------

Some of the highlights of the package include:

-   TNTP brand colors and palettes with the `tntp_colors()` and 
    `tntp_palette()` functions
-   A TNTP ggplot2 theme using brand fonts (`tntp_style()`)
-   The `tntp_cred()` functions for securely managing credentials (passwords,
    API keys, etc.).
-   TNTP-themed RMarkdown templates, for starting a new analysis with a
    shell that can already generate a TNTP-themed .docx report
-   Functions for initializing a new repository or project folder with
    TNTP-standard directories and documentation
-   Survey analysis tools such as `factorize_df()`, `recode_to_binary()`,
    and functions for dealing with check-all style questions
-   Wrappers for quickly making typical TNTP-style charts (e.g., bar
    chart of means on variable 1 grouped by variable 2)
-   Education-specific data management functions (e.g., `date_to_sy()`
    to convert continuous hire dates into school years using a specified
    cutoff date)
-   Built-in fake data sets to practice with, including student achievement 
    data (`wisc`), teacher data (`fake_county`) and survey data 
    (`teacher_survey`)

`tntpr` is built to work with the tidyverse set of packages.

Installing the `tntpr` package
------------------------------

You can install `tntpr` from CRAN as follows:

```

You can also install this package  from its GitHub repository using `devtools`.

first line in the code below as well:
